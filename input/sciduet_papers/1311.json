{"title": "A La Carte Embedding: Cheap but Effective Induction of Semantic Feature Vectors", "abstract": "Motivations like domain adaptation, transfer learning, and feature learning have fueled interest in inducing embeddings for rare or unseen words, n-grams, synsets, and other textual features.

Our method relies mainly on a linear transformation that is efficiently learnable using pretrained word vectors and linear regression. This transform is applicable \"on the fly\" in the future when a new text feature or rare word is encountered, even if only a single usage example is available.
